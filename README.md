# KAN-v1: Kolmogorov Arnold Neural Network Tutorial

This repository provides a tutorial and implementation of the Kolmogorov Arnold Neural Network (KAN), a specialized type of neural network leveraging B-splines and custom linear layers. This guide covers how to set up, train, and evaluate the KAN model on the MNIST dataset.

## Overview

The KAN model integrates B-spline basis functions within neural network layers to create a flexible and powerful architecture for various tasks. This repository includes code for defining the KAN model, training it on the MNIST dataset, and evaluating its performance.

## Features

- Custom KAN model with B-spline basis functions
- Training and evaluation on MNIST dataset
- Use of advanced optimization techniques and learning rate scheduling
- Detailed documentation and tutorial for easy understanding and modification

## Requirements

To run the code, you will need Python and the following libraries:

- `torch` (PyTorch)
- `torchvision`
- `tqdm`

Code Explanation
KAN Model Definition
The KAN class implements the Kolmogorov Arnold Neural Network, which consists of several KANLinear layers. Each layer integrates B-splines for flexible and smooth interpolation.

Key Components:

KANLinear: A custom linear layer utilizing B-splines for transformations.
KAN: A sequential model composed of multiple KANLinear layers.
Training and Evaluation
The training script performs the following steps:

Data Loading: Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset.
Model Initialization: Sets up the KAN model, optimizer, and learning rate scheduler.
Training Loop: Trains the model for a specified number of epochs and updates learning rates.
Validation: Evaluates the modelâ€™s performance on a validation set.
